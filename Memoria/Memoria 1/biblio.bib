the seven key principles of distributed systems, with extensive examples of
each. **** Adds a completely new chapter on architecture to address the
principle of organizing distributed systems. Provides extensive new material
on peer-to-peer systems, grid computing and Web services, virtualization, and
application-level multicasting. Updates material on clock synchronization,
data-centric consistency, object-based distributed systems, and file systems
